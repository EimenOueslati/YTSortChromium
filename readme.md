# Youtube Sorter
Do you watch way too much YouTube during your free / gaming / working hours?  
If as me, your answer to that question is an astounding "yes, its most likely an addiction at this point", this extension might be what you need to further fuel your habits!  
YTSort allows for sorting any amount of YouTube videos on their duration which works really well with what I call the "tab-queue" of videos.  

By middle clicking each video you want to watch and utilizing YTSort, you can quickly get a sorted list of videos to watch from shortest to longest.

## Install
Grab the newest release from [here](https://github.com/KristianSvanholm/YTSort/releases/)!  
If on firefox, simply clicking the release download should automatically install it, otherwise you will need to run it.

## API TOKEN
Create project at google Cloud and create API token with access to YouTube API V3 (public api)

Use that token when prompted for it in extension popup.

## Sort
Click "sort" in the extension to sort all open YouTube tabs in order of duration.

# Chrome
The extension has been ported to chrome by [EimenOueslati](https://github.com/EimenOueslati/). You can get it [here](https://github.com/EimenOueslati/YTSortChromium/tree/ChromiumPort).
